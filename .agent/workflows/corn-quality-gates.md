# 🌽 Corn Hub — Mandatory Quality Gates

> **⛔ ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY: Skipping ANY step below is a FAILURE. Every single MCP tool MUST be called in every task. No exceptions. No shortcuts. No "I'll do it next time."**

This workflow is **COMPULSORY** for every single task. If you skip a step, the task is considered FAILED regardless of whether the code works.

---

## Phase 0: Session Start (BEFORE any work)

**ALL 5 calls below are REQUIRED before touching any code:**

// turbo-all

1. ✅ Call `corn_tool_stats` — Display live analytics in the chat
2. ✅ Call `corn_session_start` — Start a tracked session with project name + task summary
3. ✅ Call `corn_changes` — Check for recent code changes from other agents
4. ✅ Call `corn_memory_search` — **REQUIRED with `projectId`** of current repo (or set `crossProject:true` to opt-in cross-project). Search by **feature/context keywords** from the user task, not generic terms like "session log".
   - User asks "fix auth flow" → query `"auth login authentication"`
   - User asks "tăng timeout session" → query `"session timeout heartbeat"`
   - User asks "refactor memory tools" → query `"memory store search projectId"`
   - **Multi-query** if task spans multiple domains (run search 2-3 times with different keyword sets).
   - Use `crossProject:true` ONLY when intentionally pulling lessons from other repos (rare).
5. ✅ Call `corn_knowledge_search` — Search knowledge base for existing patterns/decisions (cross-project by default, optionally filter `projectId`).

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED to Phase 1 until all 5 tools above have been called.**

---

## Phase 1: Planning (BEFORE any code changes)

**ALL 3 steps below are REQUIRED:**

6. ✅ Write the implementation plan
7. ✅ Call `corn_plan_quality` with the FULL plan text
   - **Score MUST be ≥80% to proceed**
   - If score < 80%: STOP. Revise the plan. Resubmit. Repeat until it passes.
   - If score ≥ 80%: Proceed.
8. ✅ Call `corn_memory_store` — Store the approved plan for future reference. **REQUIRED**: `projectId` of current repo, `branch` of current branch, `tags: ["plan", "<feature>"]`.

**⛔ DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE until the plan scores ≥80%.**

---

## Phase 2: Execution

**ALL 3 code intelligence tools below MUST be called during execution:**

9. ✅ Call `corn_code_search` — Find related code patterns before making changes
10. ✅ Call `corn_code_read` — Read relevant source files from the index
11. ✅ Call `corn_detect_changes` — Assess risk of uncommitted changes
12. Execute the approved plan

**Additional code intelligence tools (call when applicable):**
- `corn_code_context` — Get 360° view of symbols you're modifying
- `corn_code_impact` — Check blast radius before editing critical symbols
- `corn_cypher` — Query the code knowledge graph for complex relationships
- `corn_list_repos` — List indexed repositories

---

## Phase 3: Quality Report (AFTER all work is done)

**REQUIRED — no exceptions:**

13. ✅ Call `corn_quality_report` with 4-dimension scoring:
    - `scoreBuild` (0-25): Does the code compile/build without errors?
    - `scoreRegression` (0-25): Were any existing features broken?
    - `scoreStandards` (0-25): Does the code follow project conventions?
    - `scoreTraceability` (0-25): Can changes be traced to the task?
    - **Total MUST be ≥80/100 to PASS**
    - If < 80: FIX the issues, then resubmit.

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED to Phase 4 until the quality report passes.**

---

## Phase 4: Session End

**ALL 5 calls below are REQUIRED:**

14. ✅ Call `corn_knowledge_store` — Store any reusable patterns, decisions, or bug fixes discovered
15. ✅ Call `corn_memory_store` — Store a summary of what was accomplished. **REQUIRED**: `projectId`, `branch`, `tags: ["session-log", "<feature>"]`. Content should include: what was done, files changed, decisions made, blockers, next steps. This replaces the old `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` Section B (session log) — see `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for static repo context.
16. ✅ Call `corn_health` — Final system health check
17. ✅ Call `corn_session_end` — End the session with:
    - Summary of what was done
    - Files changed
    - Key decisions made
    - Any remaining blockers
18. ✅ Call `corn_tool_stats` — Display final analytics showing all tools were used

## Complete Tool Checklist (18/18 REQUIRED)

Every task must call ALL of these tools. Check them off as you go:

## Hard Rules

1. **NEVER skip any tool.** Every tool in the checklist MUST be called at least once per task.
2. **NEVER execute a plan that scored below 80%** on `corn_plan_quality`.
3. **NEVER end a task without a passing `corn_quality_report`** (≥80/100).
4. **ALWAYS call `corn_tool_stats` at both the START and END** of every task.
5. **ALWAYS call `corn_health` before ending** to verify system integrity.
6. If a quality report scores below 80/100, you MUST fix the issues and resubmit before ending.
7. If any tool returns an error, document it and attempt a retry. Do NOT silently skip it.
